#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, building, testing, and maintenance of software applications. Software engineering has had the following impacts on the technology industry;
1. Security and data protection. Software engineers ensure the safe development and deployment of software applications to ensure privacy and protection of user data. They also lay frameworks to prevent unauthorized access through cyber-attacks.
2. Collaboration and teamwork. Through participation in team projects, software engineers have developed a great library of open-source applications that help refine the software development process, significantly reducing development time.
3. Technological innovation. The development of new software technologies has propelled societal progress in the technology sector.
4. Driving Efficiency. By constantly optimizing the operation of software, Engineers have pushed the efficiency of applications to the upper edge, ensuring maximum benefits from the use of software products.
5. Development of new products. New software products are regularly rolled out to help solve various societal challenges.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The following is a highlight of the milestones in software engineering. 
1. The internet. It is a global network of computers over which the computers communicate with each other. The invention of the internet significantly improved networking technologies, allowing for information access on a global stage. Internet has had its impacts in nearly every sector ranging from technology to commerce, to education and entertainment as well.
2. Object Oriented Programming. It is a programming approach in which real-world scenarios are modeled in the form of classes and objects. This approach allows code reuse, which reduces redundancy, bulk, and software development time. It also allows a more sustainable approach to writing very large programs.
3. Artificial Intelligence. The branch of computer science that allows computers to decide without relying on explicit programming. It is made possible through machine learning, which utilizes data and algorithms to enable computers to detect patterns that eventually allow them to make predictions based on presented data. Artificial intelligence has had significant success, especially Generative AI, which has been implemented through products such as recommendation engines, chatbots, and speech-to-text generators.
4. Cloud Computing. This technology allows individuals to access remotely located networks, servers, services, and storage spaces over the internet. Cloud computing has helped organizations by-pass the complexities associated with local storage, increase computing space and power, and achieve better data protection in the cloud.  



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Planning phase. A problem, the need for software, is identified and defined. The scope and objectives of the software must be outlined at this stage. 
2. Design and Development. The developers create the necessary algorithms to help solve the identified problem. The framework for the software is laid at this stage. Also, the necessary tools required for the development process are gathered at this stage. Finally, the design is converted into a working prototype. 
3. Testing. The software is tested to check for malfunctions and compliance with the set objectives during planning. The software is constantly modified to ensure that it produces the intended result. 
4. Deployment. The tested software is rolled out to the end users. This step includes distribution, purchase, educating customers on the use of the software, and the final use of the product
5. Maintenance. This involves constant review of the functionality of the software and updating to adapt to changing user demands. 



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology is an approach that embraces a thorough upfront planning with well-defined sequential steps to implement a project while the agile approach focuses on flexible and incremental planning and delivery of the project.  Here is a comparison between agile and waterfall. 
	Agile
Waterfall follows fixed sequential steps while agile embraces flexibility and collaboration among developers.
Waterfall involves a thorough upfront planning wheras agile operates on small incremental fashion.
While waterfall has well-defined requirements in agile the requirements adapt to present conditions and the stage of development
Where Waterfall is rigid to changes in the project agile embraces flexibility and adaptability to changes
Waterfall is suitable when there is complete clarity about project requirements and delivearbles, with minimal need for change expected while agile is 	applied in complex scenarios in which not all constraints are understood upfront and frequent changes may be expected. 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developer- Concerned with the design and prototyping of the software application.
Quality assurance engineer, however, works to detect defects in the software to ensure its operation is within some standard. 
Project manager is concerned with overseeing the whole process to ensure proper planning, efficient resource management, adherence to timelines, and final project deliverables. 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs are the platforms where software programs are written. They bring together tools for editing, building, testing, and debugging code, thereby increasing the productivity of the developers. Examples of IDEs are PyCharm and Visual Studio Code. Below is their importance. 
	Improved code quality. IDEs provide features like code completion, error detection, and highlighting syntax errors, thus ensuring clean code.
	Better Efficiency. Through the provision of centralized development tools, automated tasks, code completion, and error detection, IDEs enable faster developments with a reduced margin of error, contributing to improved efficiency. 
	Collaboration. Some IDEs integrate with design tools, allowing for ease of collaboration between design and development teams
Version control tools are software used to track changes made to a software project, allowing for team collaboration. Examples of version control tools are GitLab and Git. 
The importance of version control tools are;
	Change tracking. It helps track all changes made to a project while also keeping the current and initial versions.
	Collaboration. Version control enables several people to work simultaneously on a project without inconvenience. 
	Error recovery. Since all changes are tracked, errors developed in later phases can easily be reversed to restore normalcy. 
	Version Control. Both the present document version and the previous ones are tracked, and clarification is given on any changes made. 
	Branching and merging. It allows for the creation of branches for experimentation and exploration of new features and merging successful ventures to the main project


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Dynamically evolving customer demands. Customer preferences may change during development forcing engineers to alter their development strategy. To solve this problem, use of a flexible project method like agile may best suit the situation as new developments can easily be considered as they come up. 
	Communication. Poor communication skills may sometimes affect communication of project details to stakeholders and collaboration among developers. Software engineers should work to improve their communication skills constantly through learning and taking challenges like presenting ideas to colleagues. Alternatively, a separate professional body may be hired to handle communications whenever resources are not so constrained. 
	Technology change. The rapidly evolving technology demands constant knowledge acquisition and software upgrades to be compatible with new hardware. Software developers should always go for the latest tech developments for their projects to avoid frequent updates in their software. Constant knowledge updates will also help keep developers relevant. 
Managing workloads. Meeting tight deadlines and inflexible deadlines is sometimes a challenge to software developers. The engineers should avoid committing to projects whose deadlines are so close and fixed that they do not give any room for flexible scheduling. Proper time management and scheduling may also be effective in meeting deadlines without so much pressure. 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing. It is a procedure used to assess the functionality of sections, functions, or programs in a software. Unit testing focuses on determining if the program functions as per the design. 
	Integration testing. The independent functions, modules, or parts of the program are interfaced and tested as a single group. Integration testing aims at detecting interfacing faults in the program.
	System testing. Tests the whole application as a single system. It aims at ensuring the system behaves as intended during the planning and design stages. 
	Acceptance testing. Is done before deployment to check if the software is ready for release. It checks if the software feature are able to meet the need of the end user. 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering is the process of designing instructions to communicate with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is important in ensuring that instructions are so well designed to ensure AI models return the most accurate responses.
To achieve this feat, the prompts must be designed around three main concepts;
1. Clarity. The prompts must be unambiguous, with no double meanings.  
2. Conciseness. The prompt must be very specific. They should probably be presented with the minimum possible quantity of text. 
3. Curiosity. One can try different versions of the same prompt to test which gives the best response. 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt: "Help me plan a vacation."
Improved prompt. "Help me plan a three-day vacation to Paris. My budget is limited to $2000 and I would like to stay in the same hotel for the three days. I want to have a maximum of three places to visit each day. In this plan, include a shopping adventure, a visit to at least one museum and a park."

The initial prompt has no specific information to guide the AI on what preferences to consider in planning the vacation. In the second prompt, the freedom of the model is confined to my preferences, giving a more specific approach to generate a response in a way that suits my demands. There is more clarity around my destination, my financial capacities, how I would like to have my day scheduled, etc.
